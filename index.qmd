## Registered Report Supplementary Material

This website provides all the scripts used to preprocess and visualize the data reported in the Nature Climate Change Registered Report:

1.  **Storm Events Data: Access & Tidy Data** describes how to access the storm events database and applies and documents all the preprocessing steps applied to the data for later use in analyses.

2.  **Storm Events Data: Analyse Data** documents analyses conducted to determine the optimal time window for conducting the study in order to maximize the likelihood of capturing suitable variability in exposure to extreme weather episodes.

3.  **Power Analyses** provide all code to simulate data and conduct power analyses with detailed explanations for the rationale and previous empirical work underlying and informing simulations and analyses.
