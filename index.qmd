## Registered Report Supplementary Information

Welcome to our project's supplementary information website. Here, you'll find all the scripts used to preprocess and visualize the data reported in the first stage of our Registered Report, which has been submitted to *Nature Climate Change*:

1.  **Extreme Weather Events Data**

    1.  **Access & Preprocessing**\
        This section provides guidance on accessing the storm events database and documents all the preprocessing steps applied to the data, ensuring it is ready for further analysis.

    2.  **Analysis\
        **Here, we document our analyses aimed at determining the optimal time window for the study, focusing on maximizing the chances of capturing meaningful variability in extreme weather exposure.

2.  **Power Analyses**\
    This section includes all the code used to simulate data and conduct power analyses. We also provide detailed explanations of the rationale and previous empirical work that informed our simulations and analyses.

3.  **Supplementary Information**\
    All analyses included in the Supplementary Information are compiled in this section. The Supplementary Information file submitted in our Registered Report was generated by rendering this website as a PDF.
