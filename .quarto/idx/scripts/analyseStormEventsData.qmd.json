Regarding H~2~, we will estimate the two-way interaction effect of political affiliation and extreme weather exposure on ΔDuration for different time periods from 30 days to 360 days in increments of 30 days. Similarly for H~3~, we will estimate the three-way interaction effect of political affiliation, extreme weather exposure, and attribution of extreme weather events to climate change on ΔDuration for the same time periods. We will visualize results of these additional analyses by plotting the two-way (or three-way) interaction regression coefficients as points surrounded by their 95%-CI on the y-axis and the 12 time periods on the x-axis, as displayed in @fig-p.sensitivity with simulated data. Based on previous research [@konisky2016], we expect that the estimated effects will decay as the number of days prior to study completion used to assess the occurrence of extreme weather episodes increases.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: sensitivityAnalysesPlot\n\nset.seed(123)\np.sensitivity <- tibble(\n  Days = seq(30, 360, 30),\n  Coefficient = accumulate(1:11, ~ .x * .7, .init = 0.1143),\n  Error = rnorm(12, .07, 0.005),\n  CI_high = Coefficient + .5 * Error,\n  CI_low = Coefficient - .5 * Error\n) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = Days, y = Coefficient, color = CI_low < 0)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CI_low, ymax = CI_high), width = 3) +\n  geom_point(\n    shape = \"circle filled\",\n    fill = \"white\",\n    size = 3,\n    stroke = 1\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"black\", \"grey\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(30, 360, 30)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Days used to assess occurence of extreme weather episodes\",\n    y = \"Regression coefficient\\n(surrounded by 95%-CI)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"None\"\n  )\nset.seed(NULL)\n\njpeg(\n  file = \"../images/sensitivityAnalyses_simulation.jpeg\",\n  width = 7, height = 5, units = \"in\", res = 600\n)\nprint(p.sensitivity)\ninvisible(dev.off())\n```\n\n![Simulated regression coefficients of interaction effects for different number of days prior to study completion used to assess the occurrence of extreme weather episodes.

Therefore, to maximize the likelihood of capturing suitable variability in exposure to extreme weather episodes, we plan to conduct our study at the beginning of August, ensuring that the 30-day period prior to study completion falls within July. Moreover, the main source of variability in exposure to extreme weather episodes in July is due to whether at least one episode occurred or not (@fig-p.hist_cont and @fig-p.hist_cont). Thus, our main analyses will focus on whether a participant was exposed to at least one extreme weather episode in the 30 days prior to study completion, treated as a binary variable. In additional analyses, we will test the sensitivity of our results to different time periods used to assess extreme weather exposure prior to study completion.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Expand for Session Info\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE}\n#| label: addSessionInfo\n#| echo: false\n\n# Save the session info as an object\npkg_sesh <- session_info(pkgs = \"attached\")\n\n# Get the quarto version\nquarto_version <- system(\"quarto --version\", intern = TRUE)\n\n# Inject the quarto info\npkg_sesh$platform$quarto <- paste(\n  system(\"quarto --version\", intern = TRUE), \n  \"@\", \n  quarto::quarto_path()\n  )\n\n# Print it out\npkg_sesh\n```\n:::\n\n```{r include=knitr::is_latex_output(), results='asis'}\ncat(\"# References\")\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r}\n#| label: setup\n\n# install package librarian if needed\nif (!(\"librarian\" %in% rownames(installed.packages()))) {\n  install.packages(\"librarian\")\n}\n\n# load required packages\nlibrarian::shelf(\n  tidyverse,\n  fs,\n  usmap,\n  ggpubr,\n  sessioninfo\n)\n\n# Source required functions\nmyFunctions <- c(\n  \"FUNStormEventsData_filterData\"\n)\n\nfor (f in myFunctions) {\n  source(paste0(\"../functions/\", f, \".R\"))\n}\n\n# Preperations to show states boundaries\npoly_states <- plot_usmap(regions = \"states\")\n\n# Read in data_details_fips\nfileName <- \"data_details_fips.RDS\"\npathName <- \"../data/stormData\"\nfilePath <- dir_ls(path = pathName, regexp = paste0(fileName, \"$\")) %>% last()\ndata_details_fips <- readRDS(filePath)\n```\n\n# Purpose & Rationale\n\nAs outlined in the Registered Report, we will assess the number of extreme weather episodes recorded in each participant's county of residence within the 30 days prior to study completion.

Regarding H~2~, we will estimate the two-way interaction effect of political affiliation and extreme weather exposure on ΔDuration for different time periods from 30 days to 360 days in increments of 30 days. Similarly for H~3~, we will estimate the three-way interaction effect of political affiliation, extreme weather exposure, and attribution of extreme weather events to climate change on ΔDuration for the same time periods. We will visualize results of these additional analyses by plotting the two-way (or three-way) interaction regression coefficients as points surrounded by their 95%-CI on the y-axis and the 12 time periods on the x-axis, as displayed in @fig-p.sensitivity with simulated data. Based on previous research [@konisky2016], we expect that the estimated effects will decay as the number of days prior to study completion used to assess the occurrence of extreme weather episodes increases.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: sensitivityAnalysesPlot\n\nset.seed(123)\np.sensitivity <- tibble(\n  Days = seq(30, 360, 30),\n  Coefficient = accumulate(1:11, ~ .x * .7, .init = 0.1143),\n  Error = rnorm(12, .07, 0.005),\n  CI_high = Coefficient + .5 * Error,\n  CI_low = Coefficient - .5 * Error\n) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = Days, y = Coefficient, color = CI_low < 0)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CI_low, ymax = CI_high), width = 3) +\n  geom_point(\n    shape = \"circle filled\",\n    fill = \"white\",\n    size = 3,\n    stroke = 1\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"black\", \"grey\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(30, 360, 30)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Days used to assess occurence of extreme weather episodes\",\n    y = \"Regression coefficient\\n(surrounded by 95%-CI)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"None\"\n  )\nset.seed(NULL)\n\njpeg(\n  file = \"../images/sensitivityAnalyses_simulation.jpeg\",\n  width = 7, height = 5, units = \"in\", res = 600\n)\nprint(p.sensitivity)\ninvisible(dev.off())\n```\n\n![Simulated regression coefficients of interaction effects for different number of days prior to study completion used to assess the occurrence of extreme weather episodes.

Therefore, to maximize the likelihood of capturing suitable variability in exposure to extreme weather episodes, we plan to conduct our study at the beginning of August, ensuring that the 30-day period prior to study completion falls within July. Moreover, the main source of variability in exposure to extreme weather episodes in July is due to whether at least one episode occurred or not (@fig-p.hist_cont and @fig-p.hist_cont). Thus, our main analyses will focus on whether a participant was exposed to at least one extreme weather episode in the 30 days prior to study completion, treated as a binary variable. In additional analyses, we will test the sensitivity of our results to different time periods used to assess extreme weather exposure prior to study completion.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"
