To this end, we analyzed records of extreme weather episodes over the last ten years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np.hist <- out$dataForHist %>% \n  group_by(year) %>% \n  mutate(\n    max_nEpisodes = max(nEpisodes),\n    yearlyMean_nEpisodes = mean(nEpisodes)\n  ) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(max_month = ifelse(nEpisodes == max_nEpisodes, TRUE, FALSE)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(\n    x = month_name, y = nEpisodes,\n    linewidth = max_month,\n    fill = month_name %in% myMonths\n  )) +\n  geom_hline(\n    mapping = aes(yintercept = yearlyMean_nEpisodes),\n    linetype = \"dashed\",\n    color = \"black\"\n  ) +\n  geom_bar(\n    stat = \"identity\",\n    color = \"black\",\n    alpha = .7,\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  scale_linewidth_manual(values = c(0.5, 2)) +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = month.abb) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"darkgrey\", \"orange\"),\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Number of Extreme Weather Episodes by Month over the Years 2014 to 2023\",\n    x = \"Month\",\n    y = \"Number of Episodes\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(size = 15),\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5)\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~year, ncol = 5)\n\n\njpeg(\n  file = \"../images/histogramSeasonalDistribution.jpeg\",\n  width = 14, height = 7.5, units = \"in\", res = 600\n)\nprint(p.hist)\ninvisible(dev.off())\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@fig-p.hist shows something.\n\n![Histograms showing the number of extreme weather episodes by month from 2014 to 2023.
