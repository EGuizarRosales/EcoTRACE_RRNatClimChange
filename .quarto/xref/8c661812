The orange bar represents July. July had the most extreme weather events in 4 out of 10 years, and in another 4 years, it was right before or after the peak month. Only episodes that included at least one of the following event types were considered: excessive heat, drought, wildfire, flash flood, coastal flood, strong wind, hail, tornado."},{"order":{"section":[3,0,0,0,0,0,0],"number":5},"key":"fig-p.sensitivity","caption":"Simulated regression coefficients of interaction effects for different number of days prior to study completion used to assess the occurrence of extreme weather episodes.
